## Sketchfab Ortographic Viewer
Sketchfab ortographic viewer with presets (left, right, top, etc).

## How to use
- Find a model on [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/).
- Copy the last part of its link (UID):
  - `https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bob-7w7pAfrCfjovwykkEeRFLGw5SXS` -> `7w7pAfrCfjovwykkEeRFLGw5SXS`
- Open [this app](https://k3rielit.github.io/sketchfab/).
- Paste that UID into the textbox at the top.
- Press Reload next to it.
- Change standard views by clicking on the buttons.
- Change the zoom with the Zoom textbox.

With this tool any Sketchfab model can be made into a blueprint:

- Open [Combine images](https://www.quickpicturetools.com/en/combine_images/) (Web app)
- Screenshot the `front`, `rear`, `top`, `side` standard views with the extension, and combine them with the web app.
